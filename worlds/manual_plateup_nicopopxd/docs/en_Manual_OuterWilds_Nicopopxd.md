## Where is the settings page?
The player settings page for this game is located <a href="../player-settings">here</a>. It contains all the options
you need to configure and export a config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?
Depend on what content you randomized; base game, dlc or both.  
For now, everything in the "0 - Beginning" category can be accessed from the start.  
- You needs the "launch codes" item to get to the ship.
- Everything that gives a signal need that signal item and the signaloscope item,
- Most "talk to" location require the "Signal > OW Ventures" signal (except for Solanum & Prisoner)
- Going to anything quantum needs the "Signal > Quantum" item (to help with progression)
- all the categories starting with "# - " then a planet name contains every locations of that planet
- For now no going into Sunless city from a shortcut unless you have "signal > distress"

## What is the goal of a Manual game when randomized?
Depend on what you choose:
### Standard(Base Game and both) or Eye
At minimum you need to have both seen and received the Adv. Warp Core and Coords for the eye and every [Knowledges](#knowledges)    
And then Grab the Adv. Warp Core in game get to the Vessel and Warp to the eye.  
For a more detailed requirement check [Here](#needed-for-go-mode).
### Standard(DLC) or Prisoner(DLC required)
You need to get to the Prisoner, your victory is when you join the prisoner in the river.  
to get there you'll need a combo of [DLC Knowledges](#dlcknowledges) and some way to get to the Subterranean Lake
### Ash Twin Project Break Spacetime
At minimum you need to have both seen and received the Adv. Warp Core and Teleport [Knowledges](#knowledges)  
then get in the Ash Twin Project and break SpaceTime thats all there is to it
### High Energy Lab Break Spacetime
At minimum you need to have "Signal > distress", the scout and Signaloscope

### Visit All Archive(DLC required)
Basically to win this one you need access to all the Stranger's Forbbiden Archives and then

## Which items can be in another player's world?
Most item can be in another player's world except for all the "Seen X" items or the "Visited Y" items  
3 random local item that are not traps are set but they can be disabled using the no local compatible option.

## What if I have items, unlocks, or locations that I'd like to not have randomized?
It's all manual. Just exclude them from either the item or location list. Just make sure not to exclude items
that starts with either "seen X" or "Visited X" and do not exclude the location that give those

## How do I install the mod for a Manual game?

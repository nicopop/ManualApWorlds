## Where is the settings page?

The player settings page for this game is located [here (WebHost)](../player-settings). It contains all the options
you need to configure and export a config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

- Everything in this manual depend on the host level you selected
  - Stuff will get disabled if your host cant access them in game

- Every Main Dish (here called `Recipe`) is an item.
  - You start with 1 randomly choosen

- Every Restaurent size is randomized (here called `floorplans`)
  - You also start with 1 "normal" floorplan
  
- Every Desk has an item and every Upgrade _branch_ has an item
  - eg. to upgrade tables you need the `Table Upgrades` item and also the `Research Desk` item

## What is the goal of a Manual game when randomized?

Get to a customisable percentage of different Main dish's overtime  
By default its 75% of enabled recipes

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Every Items can be in another'S player world except for:

- `Final Victory`
- `Victory Tocken`

## What if I have items, unlocks, or locations that I'd like to not have randomized?

- If you dont want to go to be required to beat Overtime 3 then there's the `do_overtime` option, when set to False those locations are removed  
- If you dont want to do a Main Dish just turn it off using the corresponding Option
- For anything else it's all manual. Just exclude them from either the item or location list.

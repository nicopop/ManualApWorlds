## Where is the options page?

The player options page for this game is located [here (WebHost)](../player-options).  
It contains all the options you need to configure and export a config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Depend on what content you randomized; base game, dlc or both.  
For now, everything in the "0 - Beginning" category can be accessed from the start.

- You needs the "launch codes" item to get to the ship.
- Everything that gives a signal need that signal item and the signaloscope item,
- Most "talk to" location require the "Signal > OW Ventures" signal (except for Solanum & Prisoner)
- Going to anything quantum needs the "Signal > Quantum" item (to help with progression)
- all the categories starting with "# - " then a planet name contains every locations of that planet
- For now no going into Sunless city from a shortcut unless you have "signal > distress"

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Every Items can be in other player's worlds.

## What if I have items, unlocks, or locations that I'd like to not have randomized?

It's all manual. Just exclude them from either the item or location list. ~~Just make sure not to exclude items
that starts with either "seen X" or "Visited X" and do not exclude the location that give those.~~ This is not the case anymore since those items were replaced by Events in the Async build.

## How do I install the mod for a Manual game?

There is no mandatory mods for this game. Unless you Enable 2 way teleporters logic, then you will need a mod (LOGIC NOT TESTED). For more info look at the [setup guide (Webhost)](/tutorial/Manual_OuterWilds_Nicopopxd/setup/en) /
[setup guide (Github)](setup_en.md).

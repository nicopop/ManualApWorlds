## Where is the settings page?

The player settings page for this game is located <a href="../player-settings">here</a>.  
It contains all the options you need to configure and export a config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Depend on what content you randomized; base game, dlc or both.  
For now, everything in the "0 - Beginning" category can be accessed from the start.

- You needs the "launch codes" item to get to the ship.
- Everything that gives a signal need that signal item and the signaloscope item,
- Most "talk to" location require the "Signal > OW Ventures" signal (except for Solanum & Prisoner)
- Going to anything quantum needs the "Signal > Quantum" item (to help with progression)
- all the categories starting with "# - " then a planet name contains every locations of that planet
- For now no going into Sunless city from a shortcut unless you have "signal > distress"
